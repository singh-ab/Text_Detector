Sagri's
goal of using AI
and satellite data to
transform agriculture
is exactly in line
 with my love of technology
 that has an impact. I like that 
the company is working to address abandoned
 farmland and become carbon neutral, 
especially in India and Japan. The opportunity 
to innovate and actually work on cutting
 edge technology intrigues me. I'm eager to work
 on the carbon-credit project.
I would help with data collection,
 preprocessing, and model development for soil
 carbon analysis by utilizing my expertise in 
Python, pandas & matplotlib. Having worked in
 machine learning, I would help validate carbon
 credits by supporting process-based modeling
. If need be, I can also utilize my skills in
 React, TS for developing a frontend. My
 research and teamwork abilities would
 also improve PoC projects, guaranteeing
 precise analysis and significant results.
