Sagri's goal of using AI and satellite data to transform agriculture is exactly in line with my love of technology that has an impact. 
I like that the company is working to address abandoned farmland and become carbon neutral, especially in India and Japan. 
The opportunity to innovate and actually work on cutting edge technology intrigues me. I'm eager to work on the carbon-credit project.


I would help with data collection, preprocessing, and model development for soil carbon analysis by utilizing my expertise in Python, pandas & matplotlib. 
Having worked in machine learning, I would help validate carbon credits by supporting process-based modeling. 
If need be, I can also utilize my skills in React, TS for developing a frontend. 
My research and teamwork abilities would also improve PoC projects, guaranteeing precise analysis and significant results.
